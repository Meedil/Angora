# Angora - Static Webpage 
This static webpage was an assignment from a colleague.

It was supposed to be a replica of *https://routeegypt.com/angora*, but the original page is no longer available.

In this project, I implemented my own solutions from scratch for some problems and used some libraries to solve others.

## Libraries used:
- Bootstrap 5
- Slick.js (small carousel)
- Font Awesome (icons)
- Animate.css (to help with animations)
